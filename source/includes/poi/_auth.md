# Authentication

To integrate with the Poi Network, your requests will need to be signed with your Application **API Key** (get one here).
This is done by passing the following headers:

| name            | description              |                     
|:----------------|--------------------------|
| `app-token`     | Your Application API Key |


Furthermore, if the request needs to be user authenticated (most of the time) you will need to pass the following headers:

| name            | description           |
|:----------------|-----------------------|
| `access-token`  | Authenticates the user. |
| `expiry`        | The date at which the current access-token will expire. |
| `uid`           | A unique value that is used to identify the user. This is necessary because searching the DB for users by their access token will make the API susceptible to timing attacks.|

The values for those headers can be obtained through a **Fetch credentials**, **sign in** or **sign up** request. You need to store them in your application's local database to be used in subsequent requests and refresh the token when it expires.

```shell
curl "/v1/..."
  -H "app-token: e5k0al9TBvA3Vgo4fvcgd6mDgWah0sST"
```

## Sign Up

> Request

```shell
curl "/v1/auth"
  -H "app-token: e5k0al9TBvA3Vgo4fvcgd6mDgWah0sST"
```
