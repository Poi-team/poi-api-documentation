# Poi Internal API

The **Poi Internal API** is architectured in a REST fashion. It returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes.

**It can and should ONLY be used by the official Poi Application, our Observer and special partners.**

- The *staging* URL for calls is `https://api-poi-network.herokuapp.com/v1`.
- The *production* URL for calls is `https://api.poi.network/v1`.
